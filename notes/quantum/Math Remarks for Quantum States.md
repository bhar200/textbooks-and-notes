# Dirac Notation
- Allows a more general and compact treatment of problems.
	- Easier to manipulate than $\psi$
	- Respects S.E. solutions since generalized vectors respect orthonormality and completeness
	- Reflects that operators act on wave functions like linear transforms
	- Naturally reflects linear algebra
# Hilbert Space
Every physical $\psi(\vec{r})$ must be normalizable. We study the set of square integrable functions that can be normalizable. This set of functions is called the Hilbert Space. It is a vector space (vectors and scalars uniquely determined by coefficients of basis vectors) given as,
$$\{|\alpha \rangle, | \beta \rangle, | \gamma \rangle, a, b,c\dots\}$$
which are closed under,
	- Vector addition
	- Scaling
###### Closed means operations transform to within the same space.
